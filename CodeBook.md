## Variables of Tidy Data Set

# Descriptive Variables
- **Subject** - specifies the subject whose data was measured; there were 30 subjects who participated the data collection
- **Activity** - specifies which type of activity the subject was doing for the specific measurements; Activities include: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING


# Measurement Variables
The following are measurements obtained during the experiment. Note that only mean and standard deviation calculations were included in this data set.
